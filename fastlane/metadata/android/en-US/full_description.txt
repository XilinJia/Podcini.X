Common functionalities of a podcast player are well supported:

* Search, discover and subscribe to podcasts, by key words, simple RSS URLs, or OPML files.
* Download, stream or queue episodes, and enjoy them the way you like with adjustable playback speeds.
* Save effort, battery power and mobile data usage with powerful automation controls for downloading episodes.
* If the feed contains no media (plain RSS feed), Text-to-Speech engine is used to play the text.
* Listening progress can be instantly synced through a NextCloud server or across devices in the same wifi network without a server.
