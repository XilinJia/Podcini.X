Podcini, an open source podcast instrument, attuned to Puccini, adorned with pasticcini and aromatized with porcini, invites your harmonious heartbeats.

Do I hear your heartbeats?  Great!

Common functionalities of a podcast player are well-supported:
<ul>
<li>Search, discover and subscribe to podcasts, by keywords, simple RSS URLs, or OPML files.</li>
<li>Download, stream or queue episodes, and enjoy them the way you like with adjustable playback speeds.</li>
<li>Save effort, battery power and mobile data usage with powerful automation controls for downloading episodes.</li>
<li>If the feed contains no media (plain RSS feed), Text-to-Speech engine is used to play the text.</li>
<li>Listening progress can be instantly synced through a NextCloud server or across devices in the same Wi-Fi network without a server.</li>
</ul>

So what's special with this podcast app among the many?

Well, aside from doing the above well, the following make it stand out:
<ol>
<li>It's open sourced, free to use and free of ads, free as in beer and free as in speech!</li>
<li>It takes advantage of modern frameworks to be efficient and conserve energy.</li>
<li>In addition to subscriptions, it allows you to create your own synthetic podcasts to compile your interested episodes from various podcasts to better focus on your interests.</li>
<li>While the list of episodes (filtered and sorted by you) in each podcast serves a natural playlist for you, it also empowers you with multiple queues each associable with any podcasts to group similar contents for better listening.</li>
<li>On any podcast/episode, you can assign 5 levels of rating allowing you to make better decisions on where to put your attention.</li>
<li>You have 12 levels of play states (like to play soon, add in queue, or play again) to better plan and record your listening experiences.</li>
<li>You can also keep your personal notes with your opinions/comments on each podcast/episode.</li>
<li>It has sophisticated sorting and filtering options for you to better select contents.</li>
<li>Sure, you can play any episodes in your car's speakers.</li>
<li>And, it's not all about audio, video is well handled.</li>
<li>You can cast the audio/video to Chromecast speakers/screens.</li>
</ol>
