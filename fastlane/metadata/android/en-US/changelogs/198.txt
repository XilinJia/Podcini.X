# 9.2.1

* amended addInQueue routines to handle orders properly
* likely fixed order mismatch of curQueue and actQueue
* Virtual queue size set to 50 (200 unrealistic)
* in Audo-download/enqueue, when checking if episodes are in queue, skip virQueue
* in Settings->Network, added option to disable using WifiLock (as it's reported not functional on modern Android)
* added a toggle for "don't ask again for restricted background" in Settings->Interface
* background permission request dialog now sets permission directly
* cleared some useless events
