# 8.5.3

* enhanced getNextInQueue routine
* likely fixed the nasty timeSpent problem that appears to mess up the numbers when manually switching episodes in Queues
* restored setting of prefSkipSilence, not sure how well it works though
* more printouts are stripped from release app or added to toast
* all caught exceptions are logged with toasts
* on metered network, if episode download is not set to allow, mass download shows a dialog
* some code adjustments and cleaning
