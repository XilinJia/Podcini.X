# 8.20.0

* overhauled ActionButtons routines
* in episodes lists
	* ensured button update when download completes and when deleted
	* re-enabled TTS button (somehow it was omitted) on episodes without proper download url
* avoided ID3Reader throwing exception when tag header has unexpected characters (not sure why sometimes it happens), only showing error toast
* minor spacing adjustment in filter dialogs
* amended colors in sort dialogs
* cleaned out unused resource files
