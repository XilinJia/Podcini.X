# 8.21.0

* changed feed auto-enqueue algorithm a bit: it checks in the associated queue (rather than all queues) for episodes of the feed. A bit behavior changes:
	* when maximum number of episodes remain in the queue, even some have changed status (partially played for instance), no new episodes are added
	* when some episodes are moved to another queue, then new episodes will be added
	* this doesn't apply to Only New with Replace policy, which behaves as before: checks enqueued episodes in all queues only for InQueue status
* enhanced download tasks observation
	* added Incomplete status
	* finished tasks are pruned from observations
* in episodes lists
	* download/cancel buttons are now handled more efficiently, eliminated list searches
	* download progress is now shown on the cancel button
* fixed tabs deprecation and horizontal scrolling in Search screen
* when setting an episode to Played, Skipped, Passed, or Ignored, it's no longer auto-downloadable
* likely fixed bottom sheet misbehavior (on startup or after keyboard dismissal)
* in Queues screen, likely fixed back press not returning to Queues from bin
* some code refactoring
