# 9.8.4

* when playing an episode in some list, if it's already in Virtual queue, set actQueue to Virtual queue
* when playing from FeedDetails, playInSequence is set to true for the virtual queue regardless of associated queue
* in episodes list, when long-press Play or Stream button, there is a "PlayOnce" or "StreamOnce" button, for playing a single episode
* in EpisodeInfo, icon of "add to queue" is changed
* fixed issue of curQueue not updating when changing queue from the spinner
* fixed issue of possible wrong next-in-queue
* enhanced smartRemoveFromAllQueues routine
* on PlayerUI, changed display of time left, showing all of "time left" (if speed is not 1), "remaining duration", and "duration"
* elsewhere, any reference to "time left" has speed factored in
* after media is downloaded, if parsing for duration fails, only reset the duration is the original is less than 30s or longer than 5h.
