# 8.4.0

* fixed feed statistics display numbers
* amended Statistics screen to use more state variables
* in Search screen, on return from EpisodeInfo, previous search term and results are preserved
* in global Auto download settings, added option to include/exclude undownloaded episodes in queues
	* the default includes all queues (a change from only active queue in prior versions)
	* the queue items for download are summed with other auto-download items before counting against the total global episode cache
* corrected handling auto-download candidates in relation to total allowed, likely improving situations with tight constraint settings
* added toast messages on auto-download results and errors
