# 8.24.0

* amended app init mechanism, likely fixed various strange issues
* fixed possible NullPointer in episodes lists on startup
* use one time request to schedule feeds refresh, more flexible and hopefully more timely and more frequent
	* Android may kill the refresh process if it takes over 10 minutes
	* in case of errors (including being killed), retry is scheduled for maximum of 3 times at interval of a quarter of the refresh interval
	* retry is only performed on feeds not refreshed previously
* amended streaming on mobile confirmation mechanism
	* it only appears when stream button on a list is clicked
	* if Once is tapped, it starts streaming the current episode, and all applicable episodes (on a queue) without further confirmations
* in Settings, renamed the Downloads screen to Network and Downloads, and shuffled some items with the Playback screen
* in Settings->Downloads
	* feeds refresh interval is now set in minutes (not hours)
		* default to 360 minutes, sorry no migration
		* not sure how frequent Android allows reliably (2 minute interval has been tested OK)
		* it should be set longer than the refresh duration which can be a few minutes it you have many feeds and a slow network
	* removed start time setting (on every interval setting, the schedule restarts)
* in FeedDetails screen
	* avoided possibly double assembling list
	* likely fixed current playing progress not updating issue
* added experimental feature of scheduling playing episodes
	* in any episodes list, swipe action (also in the Combo) pop up setting for "Play episode at time"
	* start time is precise as set
	* at this time, there is no further control on it, and at the end of the episode, it may continue onto other episodes (depending on the feed or the queue)
* restored alternative action buttons menu left out since 8.20.0
* fixed failure downloading previously partially/fully downloaded media
* moved some disk access calls to IO dispatchers to speed up launches
* ensured shared text starts the app in the right screen
* ensures full updates action from Subscriptions menu (though not quite necessary)
* made vms in EpisodeLazyColumn immutable
* OnlineFeed screen not exits when ShowTabsDialog is dismissed
* Kotlin upped to 2.2.20, krdb to 3.2.9
* in build.gradle, replaced setting --no-version-vectors
* some code refactoring and cleaning
