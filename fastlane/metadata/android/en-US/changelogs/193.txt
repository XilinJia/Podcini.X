# 8.25.2

* in Subscriptions screen, when refreshing feeds, network permission and availability is checked and if failure, toasts are posted
* for feeds refresh, network permission and availability checks are performed at the outmost routine
	* if failure, retry is scheduled if periodic task, otherwise only post toasts
* in FeedDetails screen, fixed the issue of feed refresh running twice on swipe (introduced in 8.25.1)
* in EpisodeState, added ERROR, and set color on some states
* Episodes lists shows play states in colors
* in MediaPlayer, if setSource has an exception, the episode is set to ERROR, and exit promptly without calling the exoplayer
* improved efficiency a bit
* some code refactoring
