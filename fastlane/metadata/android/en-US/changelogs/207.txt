# 9.7.0

* some rework of navigation and default screen
	* amended mandatory parameters of some screen to be optional (for safe navigation)
	* "Remember" can now remember basically any screen
	* when "Remember" is set for default screen it is not set as the root screen, only for next start
* in NavDrawer, when opening a top feed, nav tree is not cleared
* fixed Queues not remembering the last queue
* in sort dialog of Queues, put "Time in queue" at the beginning
* most button grids can be horizontally scrolled (compensating for long languages)
* monitoring of prefs for Subscriptions and Facets are moved to the screens
* volume adaptation is no longer persisted in episodes, it's a one-off setting in the AudioPlayer
* app build.gradle syntax change per Android Studio
